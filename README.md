## Description

LLM-based Custom PDF Chatbot is a chatbot application that utilizes a Language Model (LLM) to process and interact with custom PDF files. The chatbot is designed to extract information, answer questions, and provide assistance based on the content of PDF documents.


## How It Works

1. **Indexing:**
    - **Pipeline:** A pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. This usually happens offline.
    - **Common Sequence:**
        - **Load:** First, we need to load our data. We‚Äôll use DocumentLoaders for this.
        - **Split:** Text splitters break large Documents into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it into a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won‚Äôt fit in a model‚Äôs finite context window.
        - **Store:** We need somewhere to store and index our splits so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a VectorStore and Embeddings model.
2. **Retrieval and Generation:**
    - **RAG Chain:** The actual RAG chain takes the user query at runtime and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.
    - **Common Sequence:**
        - **Retrieve:** Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a Retriever.
        - **Generate:** A ChatModel / LLM produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data.

This project was developed as an entry for the Streamlit Hackathon in September 2023.
